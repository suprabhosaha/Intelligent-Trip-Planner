        The weather forecast for {destination} from {start_date} for {num_days} days is unfavorable

        Suggest 3 alternate Indian destinations with airports that would be better suited for a {trip_type.lower()} trip 
        around the same time. Consider similar budget range ({budget}) and traveler comfort.
        
        For each alternate destination, provide:
        - The destination name
        - A short reason why itâ€™s a good alternative (e.g., weather, attractions, vibe)
